            WAS-006
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Object Class:</strong>
            Safe
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Containment:</strong>
            <p>SCP-9562 must be kept in a 20ft by 20ft room with what ever objects SCP-9562 creates. If he reverts back to SCP-956-5 (The child) he must go to site [REDACTED] school for SCP children. No security measures should take place when an instance of SCP-9562's breaks out. SCP-9562 should be notified if any instance of SCP-9562-D is to excape his sights, and only SCP-9562 should be incharge of taking care of said instances. SCP-9562 should be free to wander to were ever SCP-9562 pleases, even if its into SCP-682's cell.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Description:</strong>
            <p>SCP-9562 is a human being with derealization and schizophrenia but he is also capable of bending reality to his whim. Telling SCP-9562 that he can control reality will result in almost no effect. It is as if the conversation never happened to him. When instances of SCP-9562-A occur, SCP-9562 will bend reality to create his hallucinations so he may destroy it or better talk to it.</p>
            <p> When SCP-9562 wishes to destroy his hallucinations he creates an instance of SCP-9562-D, although no real damage or life form is created, for no life signs are shown. SCP-9562-D does interact with the word around it. Dr. [REDACTED] has noted several other more common instances that SCP-9562 can create. These are a list of instances SCP-9562 has created sinse discovery of a pre-pubesent SCP-9562 was contained in July 18 [REDACTED]. </p>

            <strong>ADDENDUM 9562-12</strong>
            <strong><i>"The teenage years"</i></strong>
            <p>
              SCP-9562 would create an instace of SCP-9562-12, a young woman, in that SCP-9562 has told staff that she is 24 years old and lives in [REDACTED] Canada. She has been found with varing hair colour but always created naked. SCP-9562 would proceed to flirt with SCP-9562-12 as if to understand how to talk with women.
            </p>
            <p>
              SCP-9562 has been seen making sly jokes, trashy pickup lines, and even asking SCP-9562-12 to the SCP ball room dance. *Thanks Dr Bright for that idea...*. SCP-9562 would eventually have intercourse with SCP-9562-12 and they would sleep together doing [REDACTED]. The next morning SCP-9562 would vanish leaving no trace of any notion she was even there. Exept for the broken heart of SCP-9562.
